One dataset contained in the repository, heartdiseasedataset.RDS, was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mazharkarimi/heart-disease-and-stroke-prevention). It is protected by a [content license](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/dbcl/1.0/) and a [database license](https://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/).

These licenses apply also to the synthetic, derivative dataset created, heartdiseasedataset_modified.RDS. While the licenses are generally broad and open, there some things to consider:

- Attribute: You must attribute any public use of the database, or works produced from the database, in the manner specified in the database license. For any use or redistribution of the database, or works produced from it, you must make clear to others the license of the database and keep intact any notices on the original database.

- Share-Alike: If you publicly use any adapted version of this database, or works produced from an adapted database, you must also offer that adapted database under the database license.

- Keep open: If you redistribute the database, or an adapted version of it, then you may use technological measures that restrict the work (such as DRM) as long as you also redistribute a version without such measures.
